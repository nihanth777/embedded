# Smart-phone based Automatic Dispenser
## Problem Statement
This project looks into the problem of going to the billing desk after refuelling. Many a times the billing desk is qiet far and the weather is not conducive. Hence, this project tries to increase the conveniance of the customer by automating the payment process.

## Proposed Solution-
We propose a RFID based automated re-fuelling solution, which identifies the vehicle and user account uniquely using RFID tag and bills the associated user account.

## Steps to the proposed solution-
1. Identifying the vehicle using RFID
2. Communicating this information with main controller
3. Main controller communicates with the cloud
4. user receives notification on smart-phone on app and approves it.
5. main controller receives cost information from the dispenser
6. Main controller performs the transaction.
